FISSION SIMULATION:
\n\n

This is a simple fission simulation. You can choose your target 
nucleus on the left of the screen in a dropdown. Enter a thermal 
neutron velocity in the text field at the top of the screen. Select 
your desired level of detail by pressing either the A Level button or 
the GCSE button.
\n\n

When you select everything, you will see statistics appear in the 
bottom left of the screen. These are specific for your chosen 
simulation.
\n
When you are ready to begin the simulation, press the start button 
on the left of the screen. If at any point during the simulation you 
want to stop it, press the Reset button in the bottom right. 
\n\n

During the simulation you will see your selected nucleus in the 
centre of the screen. The projectile neutron is on the left. If you 
have selected a slower neutron speed (<2km/s) or a faster neutron speed 
(>8km/s) then the neutron will not interact with the nucleus, and 
fission will not occur.
\n\n

FUSION SIMULATION:
\n\n

This is a simple fusion simulation. You can choose your target 
nuclei on the left of the screen in dropdowns. Enter a temperature and 
a pressure in the text fields at the top of the screen. Select 
your desired level of detail by pressing either the A Level button or 
the GCSE button.
\n\n

When you select everything, you will see statistics appear in the 
bottom left of the screen. These are specific for your chosen 
simulation.
\n
When you are ready to begin the simulation, press the start button 
on the left of the screen. If at any point during the simulation you 
want to stop it, press the Reset button in the bottom right. 
\n\n

During the simulation, two nuclei will move towards each other and interact. 
If the pressure and temperature is too low, they will repel off of each other. 
But if they are high enough, then they will fuse.
\n\n

DECAY SIMULATION:
\n\n

This is a simple nuclear decay simulation. You can choose your unstable 
nucleus on the left of the screen in a dropdown. After selecting 
your nucleus, select a decay mode. Most nuclei will only decay by one 
mode. Select your desired level of detail by pressing either the A 
Level button or the GCSE button.
\n\n

When you select everything, you will see statistics appear in the 
bottom left of the screen. These are specific for your chosen 
simulation.
\n
When you are ready to begin the simulation, press the start button 
on the left of the screen. If at any point during the simulation you 
want to stop it, press the Reset button in the bottom right. 
\n\n

Once the simulation starts, there will be a random time to wait before
the nucleus decays. When this happens, you will see the decay products 
escape the nucleus to the right of the screen.
\n\n\n

If there is an isotope of an element you want to add, you can do so by 
opening the respective .csv file for each simulation in the program 
folder. Just add a row and fill in the information specific to your 
desired isotope.
\n
Please note that each simulation is built for specific types of isotopes. 
Heavy elements will not work well in the fusion simulation, and light 
one will not work well in the fission simulation.

DISCLAIMER:
\n
I have included accuracy to the best of my ability. However, this 
program should not be used for serious research. The main purpose 
of this program is for demonstration purposes. The processes featured 
are far more complex than they are made to seem, but this complexity 
is not required at secondary school level.
